# WebBase Client <sup>V.I</sup>

This is our **Frontend - Boilerplate**. . .<br>

Included in this template is a __**Javascript**__ environment which is an **React**, and **Sass** styled app. This template was, and will continue to be, developed into a extremely modular, clean, and  effective foundation for our future projects.

## Overview <sup>features</sup>

- [Layout](src/layouts/README.md)
- [Pages](src/pages/README.md)
- [Components](src/components/README.md)
- [Sass Presets](src/sass/README.md)

## Scripts <sup>npm</sup>

`update` : <small> Runs **"npm install"** - This will insure all the dependencies are up-to-date and the app is ready to go.</small>
